        questions = {"How might advances in technology influence investment?":"Investment may go up if the new technology might give higher profit by helping to produce cheaper or better quality products than currently used technology. Other firms may then invest to follow suit to maintain competitiveness.","How might an increase in the interest rate influence net exports?":"An increase in the interest rate is likely to raise demand for pounds, leading to an appreciation in the exchange rate, leading to exports become more expensive and imports becoming more price competitive. This is likely to reduce net exports.","What is a deficit on the current account of the balance of payments?":"A deficit occurs when a country's expenditure abroad exceeds its revenue from abroad.","What is the term given to policies designed to increase AD?":"Expansionary / reflationary","What are the possible benefits of unemployment?":"It makes employment easier for firms, and allows time for some to search for a better job. It reduces demand-pull inflation. It also discourages workers seeking wage rises or taking industrial action.","What is the most volatile component of aggregate demand?":"Investment -- spending on capital goods may rise by 60% one year and fall by 20% the next. This is because expectations vary a lot","Why is full employment not the same as zero unemployment?":"Even during periods of high economic activity, some people will be out of work due to frictional unemployment. Full employment is often taken to be 3% unemployment.","How might a change in real disposable income at home influence net exports?":"A rise in income at home may result in a fall in exports, as firms divert products from the export market to the home market to meet rising domestic demand.","How might a change in consumer confidence influence saving?":"If there is uncertainty or concern about the future, households and firms are likely to save more as a precaution against a potential sudden drop in income.","What are the disadvantages of the LFS for measuring unemployment?":"The LFS is more expensive and has the risk of sampling errors. The LFS also takes time to compile, compared to the claimant count which is cheap and fast, providing unemployment data earlier than the LFS.","Define real GDP":"A country's output (Gross Domestic Product) measured in constant prices and so adjusted for inflation.","How might a change in real disposable income influence saving?":"As real disposable income increases, households usually not only save more but also save a higher proportion of their income (APS increases).","Define quantitative easing":"The injection of a quantity of money into the economy by the central bank","Define labour force":"The people who are economically active, i.e. the employed and the unemployed. This excludes e.g. the disabled, or those who have retired early.","What are the disadvantages of the claimant count for measuring unemployment?":"The claimant count does not capture as many of the unemployed as the LFS, because there are some people who are unemployed but not claiming benefits for various reasons.\nThere is the risk that some people claiming benefits may not be actively seeking work and so not actually falling into the \"unemployed\" category.\nThe claimant count cannot be compared between countries, as different countries have different unemployment categories.","Why might a change in the age structure of the population influence consumer expenditure?":"It is generally thought that the young and the elderly spend a relatively high proportion of their disposable income (their average propensity to consume is high). This, however is not always the case.","How does wealth influence consumer expenditure?":"The more wealth people have, the more people tend to spend. Wealth can be spent and can be used to borrow against. It also results in greater consumer confidence.","Why is high employment and low unemployment a desirable economic policy objective?":"Having a higher proportion of economically active people should raise the productive potential of the economy and reduce the cost of state benefits.","How might a recession lead to a budget deficit?":"Tax revenue is likely to fall. Government spending on automatic stabilisers such as benefits is likely to rise, and may use discretionary fiscal policies to increase economic activity. However, the budget position will balance once the recession is over.","How might a change in inflation influence consumer expenditure?":"If people expect prices to go up in the future then they may increase their spending now. On the other hand during periods of high inflation people increased their saving rather than spending because they were trying to maintain the real value of their savings","How might a larger range of financial institutions influence saving?":"A larger range of financial institutions leads to competition, giving other institutions an incentive to improve. This means that people will find it more straightforward to save and have more confidence in the institutions.\nHowever in practice a larger range may lead to an increase in borrowing instead as people find it easier to do so.","Define menu costs":"Costs incurred when firms have to adjust their prices due to inflation (referring to restaurants having to reprint menus to increase prices).","Describe how CPI is calculated":"The CPI is a weighted price index.\nFirst a base year is selected, which forms a standard against which other years are compared.\nA Family Expenditure Survey is carried out, sampling thousands of households to form a 'shopping basket' of representative goods and services.\nThese are weighted according to the proportion spent on the items.\nPrice quotations are gathered for the items in the 'basket'.","Give examples of supply-side policies":"Education and training, government assistance to new firms, reduction in direct taxes, national minimum wage, reduction in benefits e.g. unemployment benefit, reduction in trade union power, privatisation and deregulation.","How might a change in the rate of interest influence investment?":"A rise in the rate of interest would be likely to reduce investment, because:\nit increases the opportunity cost of investment;\nit increases the cost of borrowing to fund investment;\nfirms anticipate that consumer demand will drop due to the rise in interest rate;\nand the demand for shares will reduce, decreasing funds that could be used for investment.","What are automatic stabilisers?":"Forms of government spending and taxation that change automatically to offset fluctuations in economic activity linked to the economic cycle","What are the aspects of government spending?":"Capital expenditure -- spent on e.g. hospitals, schools, roads;\ncurrent spending -- spent on the running of public services e.g. teachers' pay, payment for medicines for NHS;\ntransfer payments -- money transferred from taxpayers to recipients of benefits e.g. the unemployed;\ndebt interest payments -- payments made to holders of government debt, e.g. interest to holders of National Savings.","How might a change in the rate of interest influence consumer expenditure?":"A fall in the rate of interest will usually stimulate a rise in consumer expenditure. This is because it is cheaper to borrow, less rewarding to save, and those who have loans will have more money to spend.","Define consumer confidence":"How optimistic consumers are about future economic prospects","Why might a change in income at home affect the current account of the balance of payments?":"If the income at home increases then domestic consumers have higher purchasing power and thus demand more imports. This means that imports are likely to rise, and the current account is likely to move into a deficit.","How might a change in expectations influence investment?":"If firms are optimistic about future prospects they are much more likely to invest.","Define dissave":"Spending more than disposable income.","List the costs of unemployment":"Lost output; lost tax revenue; higher government spending on unemployment benefits and other government costs (e.g. healthcare); costs to those who are unemployed (e.g. health, income), hysteresis, cost to other economies.","What are the two causes of inflation?":"Demand-pull and cost-push","Define rate of interest":"The charge for borrowing money and the amount paid for lending money","What are possible administrative costs incurred by firms as a result of a high rate of inflation?":"Costs on staff devoted to adjusting accounts, assessing raw material costs, negotiating wage rises, estimating appropriate prices.","What is the distinction between fiscal, monetary and supply-side policies?":"Fiscal policy refers to changes in government taxation and expenditure. Monetary policy refers to changes in the money supply, interest and exchange rates. Both fiscal and monetary policies affect AD. Policies seeking to increase AD are called expansionary and those seeking to decrease AD are called deflationary. Supply-side policy refers to policies which seeks to increase AS.","Describe the position of the UK's current account in the balance of payments":"The UK has an overall current account deficit. There is a large deficit in trade in goods, but a surplus in trade in services. The UK usually has a surplus on income, meaning that its residents earn more on their investments abroad than foreigners do on their investments in the UK.","Why might a change in the exchange rate affect the current account of the balance of payments?":"If the exchange rate appreciates, then exports will cost more to other countries and imports will cost less to the domestic country. This may lead to a deficit in the current account.","Give examples of government spending":"Spending by the government on healthcare, education and the police service -- it does not include transfer payments","What is the Bank of England target inflation rate?":"2%","What are the two measures of unemployment?":"Labour Force Survey (LFS), based on a survey of the labour force using the ILO definition of unemployment, and the claimant count, which is the number of people claiming unemployment benefits.","Define average propensity to save (APS)":"The proportion of disposable income saved. It is saving divided by disposable income.","Define exchange rate":"The price of one currency in terms of another currency.","What is the base rate of interest?":"A central bank's official short-term interest rate. Commercial banks' interest rates are based around this figure. Also known as 'bank rate'.","What is the difference between saving and investment?":"Saving is disposable income that is not spent by a consumer. Investment is where a firm spends money on capital goods. Saving is not a component of AD; investment is.","Define economic cycle":"The tendency for economic activity to fluctuate outside its trend growth rate, moving from a high level of economic activity (boom) to negative economic growth (recession)","How might a change in the domestic price level influence net exports?":"If domestic price level rises relative to other countries, the competitiveness of exports may fall and the competitiveness of imports may rise. Firms and households at home and abroad will switch from products produced at home to those made in other countries.","What influences net exports?":"Real disposable income abroad;\nReal disposable income at home;\nThe domestic price level;\nThe exchange rate (interest rate can have an effect on the exchange rate);\nGovernment restrictions on free trade.\n","Define price level":"The average of each of the prices of all the products produced in an economy","Define imports":"Products bought from abroad","Define corporation tax":"A tax on firms' profits","Define transfer payments":"Money transferred from one person or group to another, not in return for any good or service","What influences government spending?":"The government's view on the extent of market failure;\nthe government's ability/willingness to correct it;\nthe level of economic activity;\nthe rate of inflation;\nelectorate pressure;\nwar, crime and terrorism.","Define budget deficit":"Government spending exceeds tax revenue. In this case the government will have to borrow to finance spending.","Define the term net savers":"People who save more than they borrow","Define discretionary fiscal policy":"Active, deliberate changes in government spending and taxation designed to influence AD.","Define recession":"A fall in real DP over a period of more than six months","Define sustainable economic growth":"Sustainable economic growth has two meanings:\neconomic growth that can be maintained, achieved if increases in AS match increases in AD;\ngrowth that can continue over generations and does not endanger future generations' ability to expand productive capacity.","Define output gap, and state the costs of a negative and positive output gap":"A measure of the difference between the actual output of an economy and the output it could achieve when it is operating at full capacity. The presence of an output gap indicates inefficiency.\nA positive output gap occurs when actual output is more than full capacity output. The costs of a positive output gap include unemployment, lost potential output.\nA negative output gap occurs when actual output is less than full capacity output. The costs of a negative output gap include inflation.","What are the effects of unemployment on the current account of the balance of payments?":"Although less will be produced and exported, less will also be demanded leading to a drop in imports. Overall the effect is uncertain.","What is a surplus on the current account of the balance of payments?":"A surplus occurs when a country's revenue from abroad exceeds its expenditure abroad.","What is demand-pull inflation?":"Increases in the price level caused by increases in aggregate demand.","What influences investment?":"Changes in real disposable income;\nexpectations;\ncapacity utilisation;\ncurrent profit levels;\ncorporation tax;\nthe rate of interest;\nadvances in technology;\nprice of capital equipment.","Why is inflation often overstated?":"Goods and services change, often improving in quality, which means that any price increases may not solely be down to inflation.\nInflation measures the price of a fixed basket of products. Consumers on the other hand are usually moving towards products that are becoming relatively cheaper.","What influences consumer expenditure?":"Real disposable income;\nwealth;\nconsumer confidence and expectations;\nthe rate of interest;\nthe age structure of the population;\ndistribution of income;\ninflation","Define target savers":"People who save with a target figure in mind","What are the costs of rapid economic growth?":"If the growth is achieved in an unsustainable manner, then there will be damage done to the environment. There is also the risk of depletion of unsustainable resources.","Define full employment":"A situation where those willing and able to work can find employment at the going wage rate.","What government policies may be introduced to alter saving?":"Governments can introduce tax-free saving schemes to encourage people to save more. In contrast governments can raise state pensions to reduce people saving for retirement.","Why might a change in profit levels influence investment?":"High profit levels provide the finance to invest, and contribute to firms' optimisms towards the future.","Give examples of areas of the informal economy in the UK":"Building, electrical installation and repairs, car repairs, plumbing, some street traders.","What are the two demand-side policies?":"Fiscal and monetary","State the two main measures of inflation":"The consumer prices index (CPI) and the retail prices index (RPI).","What are transfers in the current account of the balance of payments?":"The transfer of money made and received by government and individuals, such as government payments to and from the EU and money sent out of the UK by foreigners working in the UK to relatives abroad.","Define informal economy":"Economic activity that is not recorded with the authorities. This may be to avoid tax or regulations, or because it is illegal.","Define inflationary noise":"The distortion of price trends caused by inflation. With inflation, consumers will become unsure whether a rise in price reflects an increase in relative price or is just an effect of inflation.","How might a change in capacity utilisation influence investment?":"If firms are currently operating close to full capacity they are more likely to invest.","Define job seeker's allowance":"A benefit paid by the government to those unemployed and trying to find a job","Why might a fall in the rate of interest not have the desired effect on consumer expenditure?":"The expected effect is that a fall in the rate of interest stimulates a rise in consumer expenditure.\nHowever, the change can be overshadowed by the state of consumer confidence. If people are worried about the future they may not increase their spending.\nAdditionally it depends on the size of the change. If interest rates drop from 0.5% to 0.3%, people are not likely to decide to spend more because of this.\nAlso, there are some people who are target savers. They are saving to achieve a particular sum in savings. Higher interest rates would reduce the amount target savers have to save.\nFinally, because net savers are losing out, their ability to spend is reduced. If this fall in spending is more than the rise in spending by borrowers, consumer expenditure may fall. However this is not usually the case because net savers spend a smaller proportion of their income than borrowers do.","Define economy of scale":"The advantage of producing on a large scale, in the form of lower long-run average cost.","How might a rise in the money supply affect interest rate?":"A rise in the money supply increases the amount that banks have to lend, and in order to lend the extra money the interest rate is likely to be decreased.","Define average propensity to consume (APC)":"The proportion of disposable income spent. It is consumer expenditure divided by disposable income.","Define saving":"Any disposable income that is not spent. It is real disposable income minus spending.","Give examples of investment":"Spending on delivery vehicles, machines and office buildings","Why might the money stock growing faster than output cause inflation?":"If the money stock increases, forms and households have more purchasing power, leading them to increase their spending. This has the effect of shifting the AD curve right, causing demand-pull inflation.","What are the consequences of higher government spending stemming from unemployment?":"The government will have to spend more on unemployment benefits (i.e. job seeker's allowance). It also puts upward pressure on other forms of spending, such as healthcare, dealing with marital difficulties and increased crime. As tax revenues are likely to be falling, this may mean that it has to reduce spending on other areas to avoid a budget deficit.","Define deflationary policy":"Measures designed to reduce aggregate demand","Define aggregate demand":"The total demand for a country's goods and services at a given price level and in a given time period","Define deflation":"A sustained fall in the price level","What is meant by an outflow of investment income?":"This is when the investments that foreign countries make in this country earn more than the country's investment in other countries.","How might a change in real disposable income abroad influence net exports?":"A rise in income abroad is likely to result in higher exports, as people abroad demand more goods, some of which will be exported.","What is cost-push inflation?":"Increases in the price level caused by increases in the costs of production.","What factor has the most influence on a change in consumer expenditure and saving?":"A change in real disposable income","Define long-term economic growth":"An increase in productive capacity (a shift right in AS curve)","Define supply-side policies":"Policies designed to increase AS by improving the efficiency of labour and product markets.","Why is low and stable inflation a desirable economic policy objective?":"High inflation brings about several economic costs, such as menu costs and shoeleather costs. A non-zero, steady level of inflation can have benefits, such as enabling firms to reduce their costs by not raising wages in line with inflation.","What are the consequences and costs of the existence of an informal economy?":"It distorts a range of economic data:\ninflation is likely to be overstated (as inflation in the informal economy is often much lower than in the rest of the economy),\nGDP and employment figures are understated.\nGovernment tax revenue is lower.\nAn informal economy is likely to be less economically efficient as it is less able to take advantage of economies of scale.","Define inflation rate":"The percentage increase in the price level over a period of time","What are the key performance indicators of national economic performance?":"Economic growth, unemployment, inflation, balance of payments, distribution of income, economic stability.","Define hysteresis, and state its effects":"Hysteresis is unemployment that is caused because a person has been unemployed for a period of time. The longer people are out of work the harder it is for them to gain a job, leading to further periods of unemployment. Additionally the long-term unemployed may seek work less actively over time, also leading to more unemployment.","How might a change in corporation tax influence investment?":"A cut in corporation tax increases the amount of profit firms can keep and can therefore lead to an increase in investment.","What are the causes of cyclical unemployment?":"Cyclical unemployment is caused by a lack of AD, stemming from an underactive economy. In this case demand for most products will be low and unemployment high.","Define nominal GDP":"A country's output (Gross Domestic Product) measured in current prices and so not adjusted for inflation.","Define balance of payments":"A record of money flows coming in and going out of a country. The total of the balance of payments must always sum to zero.","What is the importance of achieving actual economic growth that matches trend growth?":"Trend growth is a measure of how fast the economy can grow without generating inflation. Such economic growth would avoid the costs which arise from a negative or positive output gap.","Define short-term economic growth":"An increase in output (real GDP)","What is the largest component of aggregate demand for most countries?":"Consumer expenditure (consumption)","What is the difference between production and labour productivity?":"Production is what is produced. Labour productivity is output per worker hour. It is possible for production and productivity to move in opposite directions, e.g. if more unskilled workers are recruited, production will increase but productivity will fall. This suggests that an economy may seem to be doing well but it may not be able to sustain rises in output.","How might a change in the level of economic activity influence government spending?":"If there is a low level of economic activity the government may raise its spending to increase aggregate demand and the output of the economy.","How might monetary policy be used to tackle deflation?":"The central bank can decrease the interest rate to try to stimulate the economy by reducing the reward of saving and lowering the cost of borrowing. Also an increase in the money supply can also increase AD, as people find they have more money to spend.","What might be the effects of a successful supply-side policy?":"Increase in AS leading to increased productive potential;\nreduced inflationary pressure;\nreduced structural and frictional unemployment;\nimproved trade position.","Define economically inactive":"People of working age who are neither employed nor unemployed, e.g. the disabled, those who have retired early.","Why is steady and sustainable economic growth a desirable economic policy objective?":"Economic growth brings many benefits including increasing material living standards. Steady economic growth avoids harmful fluctuations in economic activity. Sustainable economic growth means that growth can continue over a long period of time.","Define wealth":"A stock of assets. For example, property, shares, money held in a savings account.","Define net exports":"The value of exports minus the value of imports","Define hyperinflation":"Inflation above 50%","Define GDP":"Gross Domestic Product -- the total output of goods and services produced in an economy","Define trade surplus":"The value of exports exceeding the value of imports","Why must productive capacity increase in order for economic growth to occur in the long run?":"As the economy grows, its output increases. If an economy's productive capacity does not increase, the economy will hit a supply constraint -- unable to produce any more with its given quantity and quality of resources.","Define capacity utilisation":"The extent to which firms are using their capital goods","Define government spending":"Spending by the central government and local government on goods and services","Define fiscal policy":"The taxation and spending decisions made by a government.","How does saving influence aggregate demand?":"Saving is not a component of aggregate demand, however it influences the spending undertaken. Higher spending leads to higher AD.","How does a high unemployment lead to lost tax revenue in an economy, and what are the consequences of lower tax revenue?":"If more people were in work, incomes, spendings and profits may be higher. This means that the government could collect more revenue in the form of income tax. If the government increased tax rates to compensate, then people would have less disposable income. If the government chose to borrow to compensate, the rate of interest may rise. Either way people's spending power would decrease.","What government policies may be introduced to influence investment?":"Governments can cut corporation tax, or provide investment subsidies.","What type of policy might a cut in income tax rates be classified as?":"The result of the cut may be an increase in either AD and/or AS. Classification depends on the intent of the cut: if the government intended the cut to increase AD then it is fiscal policy, however if the intention was to raise AS the cut is classified as supply-side policy.","How might the age structure of the population influence saving?":"The elderly are thought to dissave, drawing on savings to maintain living standards after retirement. However some pensioners continue to save, for varying reasons.","What is included in the current account of the balance of payments?":"Trade in goods, trade in services, income and transfers.","Define trend growth":"The expected increase in potential output over time. It is a measure of how fast the economy can grow without generating inflation.","How can lost output be represented on a production possibility curve?":"A point on the inside of the PPC, not on the curve itself.","Why is economic stability a desirable economic policy objective?":"An economy which suffers from large fluctuations, with rapid unstable increases followed by periods of decline in aggregate demand, is likely to suffer from periods of inflation and unemployment, and will under-perform in terms of economic growth.","Define unit cost":"Average cost per single unit of output. It is total cost divided by number of units","What influences the rate of saving?":"Real disposable income;\nrate of interest;\nconfidence and expectations;\nsaving schemes;\nthe range of financial institutions;\ngovernment policies;\nthe age structure of the population.","Define exports":"Products sold abroad","What are the difficulties in measuring and interpreting changes in real GDP?":"Double counting, the existence of an informal economy, population growth.","What are the UK's fiscal policy rules?":"The golden rule: the government should only borrow to fund investment spending. Current spending must be funded from taxation.\nThe sustainable investment rule: the government should keep public sector debt at a stable level.","What might cause cost-push inflation?":"Increases in a firm's costs of production, such as a rise in wage rates, or raw material costs.","How might a decrease in the interest rate influence the exchange rate?":"A decrease in the interest rate is likely to depreciate the exchange rate.","How might redistribution of income influence consumer expenditure?":"Poor people spend a higher proportion of their disposable income than rich people. A redistribution of money from the rich to the poor is likely to increase total consumer spending.","What is cyclical unemployment?":"Unemployment arising from a lack of aggregate demand.","Define progressive tax":"A tax that takes a higher percentage from the income of the rich","What type of tax is VAT?":"It is an indirect tax -- the taxing of the consumption of goods or services. It is mostly regressive, as the poor pay more than the rich as a percentage of their income. However, governments tax different goods and services at different rates; basic necessities such as most foods, prescriptions medicines, children's clothing, are not taxed for VAT in order to lessen the impact of the tax on the poorer.","What are the causes of a surplus on the current account of the balance of payments?":"Households and firms have spent less on goods and services from abroad than overseas residents have spent on the country's products, or there has been a net inflow of investment income. This can be caused by:\nan increase in quality or decrease in price of its products;\na depreciation in exchange rate;\na state of recession in the economy;\na net inflow of investment income;","How might an increase in the interest rate influence the exchange rate?":"Higher interest rates are likely to encourage foreigners to place more money into UK financial institutions because of higher return. This rise in demand for pounds will push up the value of the pound, leading to an appreciation in exchange rate.\nHowever, an increase in interest rates may cause foreigners to become concerned about the economy's growth prospects, and funds may be moved to other countries, leading to a fall in the exchange rate.","Why does an increase in real GDP not necessarily mean that public happiness and living standards are improving?":"If the population has risen faster than output, then on average each person is worse off. A measure which accounts for this is real GDP per capita, which is the real GDP divided by population.\nIncreases in real GDP may not bring about immediate changes in living standards. If the increased output consists of capital goods then people will not immediately feel better off, although they will be in the long run.\nIncreases in \"regrettables\" such as policing to match rising crime, may coincide with people feeling worse off.\nIf income is badly distributed, then not many people will feel better off. Similarly if the increase in output has come about along with an increase in working hours or worse working conditions, then many people will feel worse off.\nGDP does not take into account externalities. For example if pollution rises, real GDP does not fall, even though the quality of life falls.\nPeople's perceptions of happiness are linked to their incomes relative to others. The rich are generally happier than the poor but rich countries do not seem to get happier as they get richer.","Define trade deficit":"The value of imports exceeding the value of exports","How might a change in consumer confidence and expectations influence consumer expenditure?":"When consumers are feeling optimistic about the future they spend more, as they expect their job prospects to be good and their wages to be high.","How might high inflation influence government spending?":"If there is a high inflation rate a government may seek to reduce its spending to reduce inflationary pressures.","What is structural unemployment?":"Unemployment caused by declines in certain industries and occupations due to changes in demand and supply.","What might be the effects of raising interest rate on aggregate demand?":"Overall AD is likely to decrease: a higher interest rate tends to reduce consumption; firms' investment is likely to decrease.","What causes long-term economic growth?":"An increase in productive capacity from an increase in the quality or quantity of resources may lead to long-term economic growth. For example:\na rise in net investment (also directly contributes to an increase in AD);\nadvances in technology;\nan increase in the size of the labour force;\nimprovements in education and training.\n","What does the income part of the current account of the balance of payments refer to?":"The income part covers largely investment income: a country's residents' earnings on investments abroad and the cost of foreigners' earnings on investments at home.","Why might changes in real disposable income influence investment?":"If real disposable income is increasing, demand for consumer goods and services is also likely to be rising. This may encourage firms to expand their capacity. However firms also need to believe that the rise in demand will last and that their existing capital goods are insufficient.","What is in the UK's annual budget?":"An outline of government spending proposals and any tax changes. It also provides information on th budget position in the past year and predictions for future years.","What are the components of aggregate demand?":"C+I+G+(X-M)","What are the causes of a deficit on the current account of the balance of payments?":"Households and firms have spent more on goods and services from abroad than overseas residents have spent on the country's products, or there has been a net outflow of investment income. This can be caused by:\nan increase in income at home;\na decrease in income abroad;\nan appreciation in exchange rate;\na net outflow of investment income.","Define elastic":"Responsive to a change in market conditions","Define shoeleather costs":"Costs incurred when firms and individuals make frequent trips to the bank (referring to the shoe being worn out). This is because if money is held and not saved, it rapidly loses value if inflation is high.","How can supply-side policies change the amount of government intervention?":"Some policies reduce government intervention in order to enable markets to work more freely and efficiently, e.g. privatisation and deregulation.\nSome policies increase government intervention in order to correct market failures, e.g. government funding towards education and training.","How might monetary policy be used to tackle high inflation?":"The central bank can increase the interest rate to try to reduce demand-pull inflation.","Define retained profits":"Profit kept by firms to finance investment","Define consumer expenditure":"Spending by households on consumer products","How might a change in the price of capital equipment influence investment?":"A reduction in the price of capital equipment may increase investment, as such a fall may make it viable for more firms to invest.","Define regressive tax":"A tax that takes a higher percentage from the income of the poor","Define monetary policy":"The decisions on the rate of interest, the money supply and the exchange rate, made by a central bank and/or government.","Define double counting":"Counting the same output twice, e.g. counting a raw material and again as a finished product","Define price stability":"Low and stable inflation. It does not mean a zero inflation rate.","What are the trade in goods and services in the current account of the balance of payments?":"Trade in goods, known as the \"visible balance,\" records the earnings from exports and the expenditure on imports of goods.\nTrade in services, known as the \"invisible balance,\" records the same on services, such as tourism, insurance, financial services.","Why might a change in income abroad affect the current account of the balance of payments?":"If the income abroad increases then foreign consumers have higher purchasing power and thus demand more, some of which will come from exports from the home country. This means that the current account is likely to move into a surplus.","How might a change in the rate of interest influence saving?":"A rise in the rate of interest increases the reward for saving, so usually saving increases.
