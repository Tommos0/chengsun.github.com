      <a href="ocremutiny.html">ocreMutiny</a> is a simple emulator, that implements the following assembler instruction set, along with input error checking. The emulator was written with a goal of 1KiB in mind. Unfortunately it currently stands at 1189 bytes.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use it, type in the assembly code in the textarea. Click "Load" to load in the code into memory. Then click "Step" to run the code line by line. If errors were found it will tell you which line, otherwise the line number of the line that is about to be executed is displayed. Q is the output port, and A0 to A7 show the current contents of the registers.
    </p>

      Originally the code had two parts to it -- a bytecode assembler that would parse the input and generate a simple bytecode format, and an interpreter that would consume the bytecode. However in the interests of space I merged these two together. Lexing is still done in one go on load using a regex. However, some error checking is now deferred until the line which contains the error is executed.
